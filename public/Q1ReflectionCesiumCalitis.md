# I. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

## 1.) Variable declaration
### Variable declaration like storing things in a variable. There are many keywords to use like  var, let and const. For example x = 5, the computer will store 5 inluss youu change it.

## 2.) If else statements
### If else statements lets you display something using a certain condition. If else statements helped me the most because its easy. Learning was also easy since its self explanatory.

## 3.) While loop
### While loop creats a loop until a certain condition is satisfied. We discussed it properly thats why I understand it. While loop was easy to understand since loops was easy to do.

## 4.) For loop
### For loop is like while loop but you declare the variable in the loop itself. For loop was a bit harder since you have to declare the variable in the loop. When I understanded it coding seems easier. 

## 5.) Do while loop
### Do while loop is the same as while loop. In do while you just have to separate the code and the condition. It is as easy as the while loop.

# II. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

## 1.) Functions
### Functions is basically making a code that you can call on in tha main body of the code. Functions was hard for me since separating the function out of the main code was hard. It was also because I didnt get how it to get the result of the function.

## 2.) Switch statements
### Switch statement is swapping cases based on the condition that it is statisfied. It was kinda hard since iI am more comfortable with if else statements. I also had a hard time to declare conditions per case.

## 3.) Comparison Operators
### Comparison operators compare 2 variables and writes either true or false if the condition statisfies. It was hard to memorize what they all mean. The '===' confused me the most.

## 4.) Logical Operators
###  Logical operators is mostly used in loops. It was hard to memorize them all. Sometimes i switch the meaning of && and ||.

## 5.) Assignment Operators
### Assignment Operators is the operators that assign variables their value. Assignment operators was hard to memorize. It is easier for me to do 'x = y + x' instead of 'x += y'.

# III. Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

### I plan to review more to understand all the lessons. I will do my best to review everyday.

# IV. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

### The activities 5 and 4 was the most effective since it is the foundation of everyhting. Activities 1 and 2 was kind of not effective since its too basic.
